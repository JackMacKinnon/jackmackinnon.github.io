          <p class="topic-subheading">Research and Development Engineer - 09/18-12/18</p>
          <p>
            My most recent work placement was at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teledynedalsa.com/en/">Teledyne DALSA</a>
            working to automate their testing process of infrared sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensors take far too long to test - ~90 sensors can be tested in a week
            if an operator is absolutely perfect at testing a set (and nothing breaks).
            I decided to begin to develop the testing automation for the pre-testing
            phase. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur3-robot/">Universal Robots' UR3</a>
            has been installed in the lab with a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://robotiq.com/">RobotIQ</a> gripper to work with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without going into too much detail, I drafted a development plan that
            lays out a step-by-step process on how to incrementally improve pre-testing,
            leading to a fully automated testing sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The crux of the problem is to extract an identifying label off the
            sensor and match that with a serial number on the ceramic backing of
            the sensor. The label on the sensor is a few hundred microns in length
            and width. To the naked eye, it looks like an tiny metal dent on the
            face of the sensor. The ID is unique for a batch of sensors and is a
            pairing of <em>"A-N"</em> and <em>"1-18"</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dino-lite.com/">Dino-lite</a>,
            a digital microscope, to view the sensor ID's. I then mounted it on a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur3-robot/">UR3</a>
            for portability within its workspace. This allows the microscope to be
            reliably be manipulated to resolve an ID on a newly-placed sensor. A
            basic movement pattern was created for the UR3, enabling it to move
            from sensor to sensor within a tray.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensors are placed in a 7x7 tray with "uniform" spacing, however,
            manufacturing tolerances prevent exact uniformity. At ~140x magnification,
            the small things matter. Movements expressed with precision down to a
            few hundredths of a millimetre are still not accurate enough to overcome
            tray tolerances and tray rotation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve this problem, I used OpenCV's template matching. A typical
            frame that the microscope observes consists of the sensor ID, a
            Teledyne DALSA logo/trademark, the edge of the cap that protects the
            wires and the actual CMOS sensor. The idea is, if you run a template match
            on a typical frame with a standard ID as a template, it should
            match to the ID within the frame, regardless if they have common letters
            or digits it will be <em>most alike the template</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assuming an accurate match, the centre of the match is extracted, the
            pixel-to-spatial mapping is calculated and the UR3 corrects its position
            to place the ID in the center of the frame. Now, moving from one device
            to another, the odds of the ID on the next sensor being in frame are
            extremely high.
          </p>
          <p>
            A big issue with template matching is that it struggles when there is a
            rotation in the source image in comparison to a template. To solve this,
            I decided to leverage the straight-edge nature of the CMOS sensor or
            cap's edge. In doing so, you can use the dot product with a vertical
            line (0, 1) to find your angle of rotation. OpenCV functions houghLinesP()
            proved very effective in locating edges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also made a testing-framework/pseudo-optimizing program to test the
            effectiveness of this solution. It generated millions of unique combinations
            of parameter inputs and tested them against a set of test data. Combinations
            "scoring" a higher-than or equal-to match rate than the previous best
            combination is outputted to a text file. Many 100% success rates were found.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am mostly proud of this project because of how many roadblocks it
            came across and how quickly robust, elegant and modular solutions were
            drawn up to meet said roadblocks. I'm sure you have questions, or want
            to hear more, so <a target="_blank" href="mailto:jack_mackinnon@hotmail.com">contact me</a>!

          <p class="topic-subheading">Analytical and Process Engineer - 01/18-04/18</p>
          <p>
            My first coop term was spent at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.staczero.com">STAC
            Performance</a>. STAC is a small start-up whose main product is a bike
            trainer, the <em>STAC Zero</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes STAC unique in the cycling space is the fact that their
            trainer uses <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current">
            Eddy Currents</a> to generate resistance. This distinction is important
            because Eddy Currents do not generate any sound. This is huge for
            customers in apartment buildings and close/shared spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project I took upon myself was to take an idea and develop a new
            training technology that analyzes the perceived effort of an athlete.
            Perceived effort is important for training, because it determines the
            day-to-day effort the athlete puts into their training.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hardware involves an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>,
            a spring-board and a pulse oximeter. The software is arranged into
            two different classes in C++, heart-beats and breaths. Because I was just
            prototyping, the system worked off-line; data is extracted from the
            oximeter, stored in a text file, then gets processed and analyzed by
            the C++ code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data gets processed in queues of 100; as a new value is added in
            the first value gets popped off the front. This keeps the ability to
            calculate the working average of the queue, which is helpful for
            determining which way the data is changing; ie. exhalation or inhalation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For debugging the code, I used debugging tools within the IDE, the terminal
            and graph plotting/analysis in Excel/Google sheets.

          <p class="topic-subheading">Team Member - 05/16-09/16</p>
          <p>
            The summer before my first year of university I worked in an automotive
            manufacturing plant for a little company you may have heard of... Toyota.
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tmmc.ca/en">Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada</a>
            has a plant located in Cambridge, Ontario, quite close to my home in
            Kitchener.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was working in the paint shop on the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexus.ca/lexus/en/automobiles/rx">Lexus RX350</a>.
            It was my responsibility to apply the blackout tape that goes underneath
            the trim around the windows of the right and left rear doors. In addition,
            I also worked in the inspection tunnel, examining the hood and hatch of
            the vehicle for defects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think it goes without saying that this wasn't my favorite job of all
            time. But I stuck with it, did what was required of me, and did it well.
            Four and a half months flew by me and before I knew it, the summer was
            over, and so was my career with working on a factory line.
