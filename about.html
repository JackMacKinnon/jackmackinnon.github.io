          <p>
            I have been into personal fitness now for pretty much all of my teenage
            years and early adult life. It really is like a physical form of therapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            My brother first introduced me to personal training and personal fitness
            when I was nearing the end of my freshman year in high school. At this
            point in my life I was getting more serious into competitive soccer,
            playing for the top-level rep team in my area. My brother had done a few
            summers at a performance gym for hockey training (he was also playing
            top-level rep hockey for our city), so he had an idea of what he was
            doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            He showed me some basics and instilled enough motivation in me to keep
            up with it, and before long, I was hooked. I just felt better when I
            exercised; so I did it daily. When the potency of my workouts wasn't
            what it once was, I did some Googling and came up with new exercises
            and variations to make them more effective. I also came away with some
            knowledge of human kinesiology that I applied to my own regiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got bigger, stronger, faster, and it showed. I was better at my sport
            because of it; but more importantly, I became a new person. I wasn't
            the wimpy, insecure, always slouching kid I once was. I started to
            <em>like who I was</em>, and it felt good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exercise changed my life for the better, so I continue to do it to this day.
          </p>

          <p>
            My most recent hobby I've picked up is photography.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always loved to photograph things, and I think I can attribute
            that to how I find beauty in subtleties. I remember when I was young
            I would play with my uncle's digital camera and photograph random things
            around my grandmothers house, in facination.
          </p>
          <p>
            I put my interest in photography on the backburner as I moved through
            my adolescent life. It wasn't until I worked a summer at Toyota Motor
            Manufacturing Canada that I had enough money to buy a real DSLR camera
            and dive into photography. I needed something to think/fantasize about
            while I was on the line to distract myself afterall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I almost attached photography to the cottage of one
            of my best friends, Devon. I could sit around and babble about his
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-parks-canada-expands-bruce-peninsula-national-park-with-3000-acre/">cottage</a>, well, rather his old cottage,
            but I dont think I'm able to convey how much that place means to me.
            And to be quite frank, that's something I may want to keep for myself.
            But check out the images attached to this section, it's quite literally,
            now, a Canadian National Park.
